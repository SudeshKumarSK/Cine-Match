CineMatch: Final Project of EE 541(Introduction to Deep Learning for Engineers)

CineMatch is set to transform how we discover movies by using advanced deep learning and transformer technologies. With the extensive MovieLens dataset at its core, CineMatch is designed to deeply analyze various movie features, ranging from plots, movie descriptions, genres and production backgrounds to financial metrics and popularity scores. Our mission with CineMatch is to leverage these diverse cinematic attributes to offer a selection of films that capture a wide spectrum of viewer interests. Through CineMatch, we aim to provide an enriched, data-informed movie selection experience to a broad and varied audience.
